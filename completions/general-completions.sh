# BASH GENERAL AUTO COMPLETION SCRIPTS #
#=======================================

# This section enables general bash completion features.
# Bash completion allows the shell to suggest and auto-complete commands and options.
# For example, typing 'kubectl ge<TAB>' can auto-complete to 'kubectl get'.
# The completion script is usually stored in '/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion'.

# General bash-completion script for common commands (e.g., kubectl, Git)
# Download by running following bash command: 
#OLD: curl -o ~/.bash_completion https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scop/bash-completion/master/bash_completion
# curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scop/bash-completion/master/bash_completion -o ~/.bash_completion
if [ -f ~/.bash/completions/third-party/.bash_completion ]; then
    source ~/.bash/completions/third-party/.bash_completion
else
    echo "Bash completion file not found. Please make sure the file is located at ~/.bash/completions/third-party/.bash_completion"
fi



#=======================================
# Kubectl Auto-Completion SCRIPTS      #
#=======================================
# Check if `kubectl` command exists by using `command -v kubectl`.
# `command -v` checks if `kubectl` is available, and `&> /dev/null` discards output.
# If `kubectl` is found, the following commands will be executed.
if command -v kubectl &> /dev/null; then
    
    # Load the bash completion script for `kubectl` if it exists.
    # `kubectl completion bash` outputs a completion script for bash.
    # `source <(...)` immediately loads this script into the shell session.
    source <(kubectl completion bash)

    # Create an alias `k` for the `kubectl` command.
    # This makes it faster to type, as `k` will work the same as `kubectl`.
    alias k=kubectl

    # Enable auto-completion for the `k` alias, so that 'k' behaves like 'kubectl' in terms of auto-completion.
    # `-o default` allows normal bash completion to apply if `kubectl`'s completion is not defined.
    # `-F __start_kubectl` specifies the function to handle the completion for `k`.
    complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k

# Minikube Auto-Completion SCRIPTS     #
#=======================================
# Prerequisite - Ensure bash-completion is already installed. 
# Can install with command: choco install bash-completion
source <(minikube completion bash)


#=========================================
# DOCKER CLI Auto-Completion SCRIPTS     #
#=========================================
# Enable Docker CLI auto-completion (including Docker Compose v2 - "docker compose" not "docker-compose" which is v1).
# This command dynamically generates the auto-completion script for Docker commands.
# When you type a command like 'docker ru<TAB>', it auto-completes to 'docker run', and similarly for Docker Compose commands 'docker compose exec <will provide all service names running>'.
# The command 'docker completion bash' outputs a Bash script that defines completions for Docker commands. When you wrap it with eval "$( ... )", the shell immediately evaluates the script and loads the completions
eval "$(docker completion bash)"
