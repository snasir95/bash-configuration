# Main BASH configuration file that will be sourced by the .bashrc file. 
# This file acts as the central point for sourcing all custom configurations from ~/.bash directory.
# The .bashrc file will be very simple, it will only source this file.
# Example of sourcing main configuration from .bash directory. Only the following lines below will be added to .bashrc file located in the home directory.
# if [ -f ~/.bash/main ]; then
#     source ~/.bash/main

# Check if shell is running interactively
# $- is a string containing current shell options (i = interactive shell)
# != means "not equal to"
# *i* checks if 'i' appears anywhere in the string
# && means "and" - only execute the next command if the previous one is true
# return exits the script if shell is non-interactive
[[ $- != *i* ]] && return

# for file in: starts a loop that will process each matching file
